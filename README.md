## Security policy for Reboot Games - 

### Definition - What is a Security Policy?

A security policy is a document that a company writes to outline how they protect themselves from threats which includes computer security threats and how to handle the situations if a threat was to come up. The policy must identify all the companyâ€™s assets as well as all the potential threats it faces as a business. The security policy should be updated and managed regularly if anything changes within the company. Therefore, most policies are running documents which means they are never finished due to the development of technology

### Hardware/software used:

The hardware and software that is used within Reboot Games to keep are business safe and secure. We also have the most update hardware and software to keep up with other companies to stay competitive for work and clients. One example that we have is the college has security barriers so only students with a card can pass though. This stops unauthorised access to the college happening. If they were to somehow get past that then the room we are in again has a card id lock which only Reboot Games members can get into. The college also has a lot of software which maintains and protects the students such as anti-virus and firewall.
