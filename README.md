## Security policy for Reboot Games - 

### Definition - What is a Security Policy?

A security policy is a document that a company writes to outline how they protect themselves from threats which includes computer security threats and how to handle the situations if a threat was to come up. The policy must identify all the company’s assets as well as all the potential threats it faces as a business. The security policy should be updated and managed regularly if anything changes within the company. Therefore, most policies are running documents which means they are never finished due to the development of technology  

## Outline of business -

### Number of staff:

### Hardware/software used:

The hardware and software that is used within Reboot Games to keep are business safe and secure. We also have the most update hardware and software to keep up with other companies to stay competitive for work and clients. One example that we have is the college has security barriers so only students with a card can pass though. This stops unauthorised access to the college happening. If they were to somehow get past that then the room we are in again has a card id lock which only Reboot Games members can get into. The college also has a lot of software which maintains and protects the students such as anti-virus and firewall. 

### Nature of work:

The work that Reboot Games do is mainly project work for clients that approach us with an idea that they want to turn in either a Game, Business Application or pretty much any application. We have done work for ZSL Whipsnade where we had to create an educational game for kids / Young teenagers. We are also linked with driving schools to make a driving simulator on mobile. Recently we were approached by a disaster recovery team to make them a business application as well. We are pretty much an open company with experience in many fields. So, the clients approach us and we see what’s best for them and the company of reboot games 

## Risks to reboot games - 

* Physical
* Data
* Social Engineering     

### Physical

Firstly physical, the physical risks to reboot games are anything to do with the college itself or are room which we work out of. For example, if we were to experience theft of are PCs or damage to them we could lose vital data. These risks can be prevented employers like us from working and that causes more problems when work for clients is not being completed.    

### Data

The second main risk for Reboot Games is about the data. The reason behind this is that if data becomes corrupted, lost or even stolen it could mean projects are lost or personal data could be stolen which could lead to other risks like theft. If data is to become corrupted normally there is no way back to get it therefore company’s save backups. If you are working towards a project deadline and you are closing in on it then your work gets corrupt then it could mean that you miss the deadline and not get payed. 

### Social Engineering

The third main risk for Reboot Games is Social engineering. The reason for this if someone within Reboot Games is selling private data to a rival company for self-gain or if a employee was manipulated into giving up information. Also, if someone is allowing access to private parts of Reboot Games to be accessed by out siders then this can cause data to go missing or companies to get one ups on Reboot Games. This can bring the representation down of the company and cause them to get no work. Also, it will make rival companies harder to reach as they will always be able to see what you are doing and one upping it
