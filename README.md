## Security policy for Reboot Games - 

### Definition - What is a Security Policy?

A security policy is a document that a company writes to outline how they protect themselves from threats which includes computer security threats and how to handle the situations if a threat was to come up. The policy must identify all the company’s assets as well as all the potential threats it faces as a business. The security policy should be updated and managed regularly if anything changes within the company. Therefore, most policies are running documents which means they are never finished due to the development of technology  

## Outline of business -

### Number of staff:

In Reboot games there are 15 employees. One main founder or CEO and then the other 14 employees whose role is to work on given projects and jobs which is given to them by the CEO.

### Structure:

### Hardware/software used:

The hardware and software that is used within Reboot Games to keep are business safe and secure. We also have the most update hardware and software to keep up with other companies to stay competitive for work and clients. One example that we have is the college has security barriers so only students with a card can pass though. This stops unauthorised access to the college happening. If they were to somehow get past that then the room we are in again has a card id lock which only Reboot Games members can get into. The college also has a lot of software which maintains and protects the students such as anti-virus and firewall. 

### Nature of work:

The work that Reboot Games do is mainly project work for clients that approach us with an idea that they want to turn in either a Game, Business Application or pretty much any application. We have done work for ZSL Whipsnade where we had to create an educational game for kids / Young teenagers. We are also linked with driving schools to make a driving simulator on mobile. Recently we were approached by a disaster recovery team to make them a business application as well. We are pretty much an open company with experience in many fields. So, the clients approach us and we see what’s best for them and the company of reboot games 

## Risks to reboot games - 

* Physical
* Data
* Social Engineering     

### Physical

Firstly physical, the physical risks to reboot games are anything to do with the college itself or are room which we work out of. For example, if we were to experience theft of are PCs or damage to them we could lose vital data. These risks can be prevented employers like us from working and that causes more problems when work for clients is not being completed.    

### Data

The second main risk for Reboot Games is about the data. The reason behind this is that if data becomes corrupted, lost or even stolen it could mean projects are lost or personal data could be stolen which could lead to other risks like theft. If data is to become corrupted normally there is no way back to get it therefore company’s save backups. If you are working towards a project deadline and you are closing in on it then your work gets corrupt then it could mean that you miss the deadline and not get payed. 

### Social Engineering

The third main risk for Reboot Games is Social engineering. The reason for this if someone within Reboot Games is selling private data to a rival company for self-gain or if a employee was manipulated into giving up information. Also, if someone is allowing access to private parts of Reboot Games to be accessed by out siders then this can cause data to go missing or companies to get one ups on Reboot Games. This can bring the representation down of the company and cause them to get no work. Also, it will make rival companies harder to reach as they will always be able to see what you are doing and one upping it  

## Differnet Threats an Organisation Faces

### Viruses

Viruses are files that can made so that they are very dangerous to a computer system because of the power of the code that sits inside them and once run it can cause hell for a PC. Some can copy itself to storage devices and corrupt all the data within. The way it does this is by infecting other files in the system and spready hence the name Virus. It spreads and you can’t stop it. Viruses can be detected by antivirus and malware software. This is why they are so important otherwise you have no protection from the files you are downloading. 

### Internal Leaks

Internal leaks are the process of an employee within a company that may hold information or have access to information that could be vital for another company exposes the information and leaks it to the public. Sometimes this can be accidental as there are many ways for information to be leaked. For example, a data hack from an anonymous location who found his way in to the company. But sometimes it can be employees. Most companies try to solve this problem by having employees sign a non-disclosure form when joining the business, this is a form that is used to keep the information of a company internal and not to be shared, by signing these forms the employee cannot leak any information from the company that isn't public knowledge, if there was a known leak in the company, the company could sue that person for breaching the form.

### Phising 

Phishing is the act when someone anonymous is sending you fake emails or messages that are trying to trick you into believing they are real so you either download something or enter your details to them. This is one of the most common ways hackers will try to get your details online as they can make it look so legit that it has come from the real company but when you look deeper normally into their email name you can see if it is real or fake  

### Power Cut

Power cut
Power cuts can be very unpredictable and can happen at any time. There are many different causes of a power cut for example. Weather, electrical trip or someone shutting it down. The problem with power cuts is that they can’t not be predicted so they are hard to reduce the risk. The only thing companies do is keep regular saves of work and data. Sometimes companies have backup generators but these take time to kick in and only last a certain amount of time. 

## Security Procedures

Security procedures is all about how company’s keep their data and employees safe online and in real life. Many companies do this in different ways as companies in different fields have different ways of being safe in their field. Within Reboot Games there is many layers of security to keep are organisation protected. Most of these are provided by the college as the college has its own security to keep people out that are not meant to be in the college. Some different procedures in Reboot Games are:

* ID Pass
* Logging In
* Locked Door

### ID Pass (Entering The Building)

The college that Reboot Games is in has security gates just indie the doors which when u get up to them you must have your ID pass which is given to you when you join the college. You swipe it and the gates open allowing you to pass though. If you don’t have your college pass they ask you a series of questions which then they allow you though. So, anyone that is not involved in the college cannot get through the gates into the college. The steps to get into the college would look like this:

### Logging In

When logging into a PC at the college you have to put in your user name and password. The user name is generated by the college when you join but you set your own password. You are able to log into any PC in the college with your details as all of the PCs are ran off of a server which stores your work so when you save your work you can access it again at a different PC so if someone was to hack onto someone’s PC with no one logged in they would not be able to get anything. Another good thing is that most of the PCs are restricted use. So even if someone was trying to download something it would not be able to.

### Lock On The Class Door

Another security procedure in Reboot Games is the Security door that we have on are room within the college. The only people that can get through the door into are room are employees of Reboot Games and the CEO, any other student with a ID Pass can’t not open the door. In order to gain access to the room you must complete the following steps:

![door](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927415/40424176-a7846e7c-5e8c-11e8-87a5-6d259905f86f.JPG)

This is also another security benefit as if someone was to get hold of a random college card and get through the gates they would still not be able to get into are room as you need a employees of Reboot Games ID card. 


## Data Protection

Data protection is the rule that user’s data online in the compony of Reboot Games must be protected and cannot be used or gathered without the company or user’s knowledge. The data protection act prevents s the misuse of customers data and prevents business and organisations from using their data without the persons permission. An update has been made to the data protection act in 2017 which allows any user to back out of an agreement at any time and for their data to be deleted off their databases as a part of the new agreement. Every company has to agree with terms also if they do not they can face a big fine and lose a lot of reputation for their company. When Reboot Games is working on a project or handling client’s data it must be keep safe inside the business and not used for anything other then what you agreed with the client.
