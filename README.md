# Security

## Security policy for Reboot Games - 

### Definition - What is a Security Policy?

A security policy is a document that a company writes to outline how they protect themselves from threats which includes computer security threats and how to handle the situations if a threat was to come up. The policy must identify all the company’s assets as well as all the potential threats it faces as a business. The security policy should be updated and managed regularly if anything changes within the company. Therefore, most policies are running documents which means they are never finished due to the development of technology  

## Outline of business -

### Number of staff:

In Reboot games there are 15 employees. One main founder or CEO and then the other 14 employees whose role is to work on given projects and jobs which is given to them by the CEO.

### Structure:
![rrf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927415/40374020-1b62b3e2-5de0-11e8-9b3b-d471f308e226.JPG)

### Hardware/software used:

The hardware and software that is used within Reboot Games to keep are business safe and secure. We also have the most update hardware and software to keep up with other companies to stay competitive for work and clients. One example that we have is the college has security barriers so only students with a card can pass though. This stops unauthorised access to the college happening. If they were to somehow get past that then the room we are in again has a card id lock which only Reboot Games members can get into. The college also has a lot of software which maintains and protects the students such as anti-virus and firewall. 

### Nature of work:

The work that Reboot Games do is mainly project work for clients that approach us with an idea that they want to turn in either a Game, Business Application or pretty much any application. We have done work for ZSL Whipsnade where we had to create an educational game for kids / Young teenagers. We are also linked with driving schools to make a driving simulator on mobile. Recently we were approached by a disaster recovery team to make them a business application as well. We are pretty much an open company with experience in many fields. So, the clients approach us and we see what’s best for them and the company of reboot games 

## Risks to reboot games - 

* Physical
* Data
* Social Engineering     

### Physical

Firstly physical, the physical risks to reboot games are anything to do with the college itself or are room which we work out of. For example, if we were to experience theft of are PCs or damage to them we could lose vital data. These risks can be prevented employers like us from working and that causes more problems when work for clients is not being completed.    

### Data

The second main risk for Reboot Games is about the data. The reason behind this is that if data becomes corrupted, lost or even stolen it could mean projects are lost or personal data could be stolen which could lead to other risks like theft. If data is to become corrupted normally there is no way back to get it therefore company’s save backups. If you are working towards a project deadline and you are closing in on it then your work gets corrupt then it could mean that you miss the deadline and not get payed. 

### Social Engineering

The third main risk for Reboot Games is Social engineering. The reason for this if someone within Reboot Games is selling private data to a rival company for self-gain or if a employee was manipulated into giving up information. Also, if someone is allowing access to private parts of Reboot Games to be accessed by out siders then this can cause data to go missing or companies to get one ups on Reboot Games. This can bring the representation down of the company and cause them to get no work. Also, it will make rival companies harder to reach as they will always be able to see what you are doing and one upping it  

## Differnet Threats an Organisation Faces

### Viruses

Viruses are files that can made so that they are very dangerous to a computer system because of the power of the code that sits inside them and once run it can cause hell for a PC. Some can copy itself to storage devices and corrupt all the data within. The way it does this is by infecting other files in the system and spready hence the name Virus. It spreads and you can’t stop it. Viruses can be detected by antivirus and malware software. This is why they are so important otherwise you have no protection from the files you are downloading. 

### Internal Leaks

Internal leaks are the process of an employee within a company that may hold information or have access to information that could be vital for another company exposes the information and leaks it to the public. Sometimes this can be accidental as there are many ways for information to be leaked. For example, a data hack from an anonymous location who found his way in to the company. But sometimes it can be employees. Most companies try to solve this problem by having employees sign a non-disclosure form when joining the business, this is a form that is used to keep the information of a company internal and not to be shared, by signing these forms the employee cannot leak any information from the company that isn't public knowledge, if there was a known leak in the company, the company could sue that person for breaching the form.

### Phising 

Phishing is the act when someone anonymous is sending you fake emails or messages that are trying to trick you into believing they are real so you either download something or enter your details to them. This is one of the most common ways hackers will try to get your details online as they can make it look so legit that it has come from the real company but when you look deeper normally into their email name you can see if it is real or fake  

### Power Cut

Power cut
Power cuts can be very unpredictable and can happen at any time. There are many different causes of a power cut for example. Weather, electrical trip or someone shutting it down. The problem with power cuts is that they can’t not be predicted so they are hard to reduce the risk. The only thing companies do is keep regular saves of work and data. Sometimes companies have backup generators but these take time to kick in and only last a certain amount of time. 

## Security Procedures

Security procedures is all about how company’s keep their data and employees safe online and in real life. Many companies do this in different ways as companies in different fields have different ways of being safe in their field. Within Reboot Games there is many layers of security to keep are organisation protected. Most of these are provided by the college as the college has its own security to keep people out that are not meant to be in the college. Some different procedures in Reboot Games are:

* ID Pass
* Logging In
* Locked Door

### ID Pass (Entering The Building)

The college that Reboot Games is in has security gates just indie the doors which when u get up to them you must have your ID pass which is given to you when you join the college. You swipe it and the gates open allowing you to pass though. If you don’t have your college pass they ask you a series of questions which then they allow you though. So, anyone that is not involved in the college cannot get through the gates into the college. The steps to get into the college would look like this:

### Logging In

When logging into a PC at the college you have to put in your user name and password. The user name is generated by the college when you join but you set your own password. You are able to log into any PC in the college with your details as all of the PCs are ran off of a server which stores your work so when you save your work you can access it again at a different PC so if someone was to hack onto someone’s PC with no one logged in they would not be able to get anything. Another good thing is that most of the PCs are restricted use. So even if someone was trying to download something it would not be able to.

### Lock On The Class Door

Another security procedure in Reboot Games is the Security door that we have on are room within the college. The only people that can get through the door into are room are employees of Reboot Games and the CEO, any other student with a ID Pass can’t not open the door. In order to gain access to the room you must complete the following steps:

![door](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927415/40424176-a7846e7c-5e8c-11e8-87a5-6d259905f86f.JPG)

This is also another security benefit as if someone was to get hold of a random college card and get through the gates they would still not be able to get into are room as you need a employees of Reboot Games ID card. 


## Data Protection

Data protection is the rule that user’s data online in the compony of Reboot Games must be protected and cannot be used or gathered without the company or user’s knowledge. The data protection act prevents s the misuse of customers data and prevents business and organisations from using their data without the persons permission. An update has been made to the data protection act in 2017 which allows any user to back out of an agreement at any time and for their data to be deleted off their databases as a part of the new agreement. Every company has to agree with terms also if they do not they can face a big fine and lose a lot of reputation for their company. When Reboot Games is working on a project or handling client’s data it must be keep safe inside the business and not used for anything other then what you agreed with the client. 

## Network Security

### DMZ

DMZ is a physical or a sub network that contains and exposes organisations external facing services to an untrusted network.it can be used to allow people to access a webpage being hosted on a network. An example of this is an email server can be put in a DMZ to allow different groups to access the servers. This can come from an internal or external source. DMZ also provides an additional layer of security to and organisations LAN. The DMZ functions as a small, isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network and effective, allows the organization extra time to detect and address breaches before they would further penetrate into the internal networks

Adding a DMZ to Reboot Games could be extremely helpful to us and other companies as the servers will be able to be safely accessed to all sources without putting the LAN in danger from being damaged. This can be very important for a company as it means that their personal server is still disconnected from the server clients are accessing. DMZ adds another layer of security to the business and allows safer server management, as well as the event of an attack can much safer as it will only affect the DMZ and not the LAN.

### Static IP

IP is a permanent number given to a computer or any device that connects to the internet. It is assigned to the device by an internet service provider. It works like a house number and street name as it is used to locate different networks. One problem with if people find out your PCs IP is it is like getting someone’s address. You can see where they are and people can have sent stuff directly to your PC. The IP is the address of the network, it is vital for networks to communicate with each other on the internet. The difference between static IP and a network IP is that a Static IP will always stay with the device it is assigned to. But a IP on a network will change with the network. Having a static IP address means that security measures can be added to that specific IP address which allows for a lot more configuration and security. 

### NAT

A Network Address Translation is a method of giving a device within a private network a public address. The public address will be correctly configured to add a layer of security because of the new IP Address the internal IP is hidden and whenever the network is accessed it will accessed with the public IP instead of the private one. This adds more security to the IP. Attacks that target the IP address will target the public instead of private IP  

## Impact Of Incorrect Configuration Of Firewall Policies And Third Party VPNs

### VPN

Many people and companies use VPNs these days to stay safe online. VPN involves giving you a public IP Address to use when using a private network. So, it keeps your real location and data safe. VPNs are used to allow safe transfer of data online usually when data is sent the packet would travel though public domains to be successfully transferred. But when using a VPN, it is a private connection that involves two IPs connecting with each other privately this means that when the two systems want to transfer files or data to each other, they can go through a private network rather than risking putting it on a public domain in which it could be seen and tracked. All companies want is to be able to have as much security for their data when it is in all stages like. Storage, being worked on and when it is sent / uploaded and this is when VPNs come in as it adds a false IP to your PC so if you get phished into connecting to a harmful network they will only get the VPN IP.

There are some draw backs to using a VPN since it is a private network. Sometimes you will have to pay to use someone’s VPN. Also, whoever owns the VPN can see what is transferred so this can be a way that data is leaked. Another drawback of VPN is that it uses IPs that they may have used before when some else uses their VPN so someone may have done something to the IP and now it goes to you PC and if they do something it is now linked to your PC. 

### Firewall

A firewall is a piece of software that decides what data / traffic is allowed in and out of your PC. You can strengthen and reduce the rules in the firewall that makes the decision on if a packet of data is aloud though. There are two routes for data when it reaches the fire wall. Either it allows it though to continue to its destination or it gets blocked and sent back to where it came from with a message saying why it was not allowed though. 

If a Firewall is incorrectly set up then it can open the doors on your PC to lots of risks. For example, if you are using a third-party VPN their servers ae usually public to anyone who signs in to the service. And if someone was to infect all the users and you have no firewall then your PC would get filled up with harmful virus and other dangerous malware.  

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Explanation | Danger | How To Prevent The Risk  |
| ---- | -----------  | ------------------ | -------- |
| Internal leaks | Information About The Company Leaked From Within | Medium | Find Out Who Is The Leak
| Power Cut | All Power To The Building Goes Out| Medium | Save Back Ups 24/7, Tranfer Back Ups To Servers |
| Theft | Someone Breaking In And Stealing Equipment | High | Making Sure All Doors Are Locked And Alarms Are Set |
| Viruses | The PCs Get Malicious Software| High | Making Sure All Anti-Virus Software Is Updated |


## Disaster Recovery Plan

When companies are dealing with risks within their business. There are moments in which if the risk is successful in hindering the business in any major way. Then the company must have plans ready in place to make sure that they make the damage as minimal as possible and manage it so that it does not cause any fatal damage in the business. There are many different steps to make sure that this process of recovery is successful 

### Recovery Process / Recovery Time 

The recovery process is where a business will look the different pieces of work that they have done and prioritise them depending on their importance to the company. The more important jobs of the business will be given more protection as if they are lost then it would be harder to recover the work back. This step within the disaster recovery plan is very important as it means that the major assets are protected and prioritised which in the event of a risk can be very helpful.

Recovery time is the time that a computer system or network is down for after a failure or disaster occurs. The recovery time is a function of the extent to which the interruption disrupts normal operations and the amount of revenue that the company has lost per time unit. It can be measured in Seconds, Minutes, Hours or Days. As well as all of this they will also identify the flaws that made the down time and try to improve it so it doesn’t happen again.
